#here we specify the services to run, we can name it anywa, but it is a
#good practice to name it after the service it is running, for example:
#to run a DB we can name it 'myDB' or similar, but its recommended to
#name it according to the db it is running on
services:
  postgres:
    image: postgres:13
    container_name: my_container_db
    #environmet variables we want to use and its value
    environment:

      - POSTGRES_USER=ajulian
      - POSTGRES_PASSWORD=admin123
    ports:
      - 5432:5432
    #the location of the volume depends on the specific DB we are using
    # we can check on https://hub.docker.com/ and DB name, in this case:
    #https://hub.docker.com/_/postgres  scroll down to PGDATA
    volumes:
      - ./postgres_data:/var/lib/postgresql/data

#to run this services:
 # docker-compose up -d service_name, in this case postgres, -d is for detached (run behind)
